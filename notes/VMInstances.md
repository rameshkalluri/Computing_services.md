# Instance Templates in GCP VM Instances

Instance Templates in GCP (Google Cloud Platform) are configuration blueprints used for creating VM (Virtual Machine) instances. They allow you to define key settings for VM instances in a reusable way, streamlining the process of launching multiple VMs with consistent configurations.

## Key Features
- **Configuration Blueprint**: Define machine type, disk configuration, network settings, metadata, and startup scripts.
- **Reusability**: Use the same template to launch multiple identical VM instances.
- **Scalability**: Essential for managed instance groups, enabling auto-scaling and load balancing.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Helps standardize instance configurations, reducing errors and optimizing resource allocation.
- **Immutability**: Instance templates cannot be edited after creation, ensuring consistency.

## Use Cases
- **Managed Instance Groups (MIGs)**: Deploy and scale identical instances automatically.
- **Load Balancing**: Create backend instances with uniform configurations.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Quickly recreate instances in case of failure.

## Steps to Create an Instance Template

### Via GCP Console
1. Navigate to **Compute Engine** > **Instance Templates**.
2. Click **Create Instance Template**.
3. Configure the desired options:
   - Machine type
   - Boot disk
   - Network settings
   - Metadata and startup scripts
4. Click **Create** to save the template.

# Instance Schedules in GCP

**Instance Schedules** in Google Cloud allow you to automatically start and stop **Compute Engine VM instances** based on a schedule. This can help you optimize costs by ensuring that VMs are only running when needed (e.g., during business hours) and are automatically stopped when not in use (e.g., outside business hours).

## Key Features of Instance Schedules:

1. **Cost Optimization**: By automatically starting and stopping VMs, you can reduce costs, especially for non-production or development environments that do not need to run 24/7.
2. **Automated Start and Stop**: You can configure the schedules to trigger VM startup and shutdown at specific times of the day, week, or month.
3. **Granular Control**: The schedules can be set for individual VM instances or groups of VMs. You can also apply schedules to specific regions, project-wide, or for specific use cases.
4. **Integration with Cloud Scheduler**: The scheduling is integrated with **Google Cloud Scheduler**, which allows you to define cron-like jobs to trigger the start and stop actions.

## How Instance Schedules Work:

- **Start and Stop VMs**: You can define schedules that trigger VM instances to start and stop at specific times, using Cloud Scheduler, based on cron syntax.
- **Regional or Global**: Instance schedules can apply to specific regions or be global (for a project-wide schedule).
- **Time Zones**: The scheduling is flexible and can be set in different time zones, allowing you to customize schedules for your needs, regardless of the region.
- **VM Status**: The VM will be stopped (deallocated) when the schedule is triggered, ensuring that it no longer consumes running costs.

## Use Case Example:

For instance, if you have a development environment that only needs to run during business hours (9 AM to 6 PM), you can set up an instance schedule to:

- **Start** the VM at 9 AM every weekday.
- **Stop** the VM at 6 PM every weekday.

This ensures that you are not paying for idle VM time during the night or weekends.

## Setting Up Instance Schedules:

1. **Create an Instance Schedule**:
   - Navigate to the **Google Cloud Console**.
   - Go to **Compute Engine** > **Instance schedules**.
   - Click **Create schedule** and define the schedule settings.
   
2. **Define Schedule Parameters**:
   - **Name**: Give the schedule a unique name.
   - **Start/Stop Times**: Set the exact time and frequency for starting and stopping the VM.
   - **Time Zone**: Select the time zone for the schedule.
   
3. **Apply Schedule to Instances**:
   - You can assign the schedule to specific VM instances or groups of instances (Managed Instance Groups).

## Benefits:

Cost Savings: By ensuring that VMs are not running when they aren't needed, you can optimize your Google Cloud costs.

Automation: Automates the management of VM uptime, reducing manual intervention.

Custom Schedules: Flexibility in setting custom schedules based on your operational needs.

# Sole-Tenant Nodes in GCP

**Sole-Tenant Nodes** in Google Cloud provide dedicated, physical compute resources for your virtual machine instances. Unlike standard Google Cloud virtual machine instances that run on shared physical hardware, sole-tenant nodes ensure that your VMs run on a dedicated physical server, which is not shared with other customers' workloads.

## Key Features of Sole-Tenant Nodes:

1. **Dedicated Physical Resources**:
   - The VMs run on physical machines that are **dedicated** to a specific customer. This means that the hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc.) are not shared with other tenants.

2. **Compliance and Security**:
   - Useful for workloads that have **strict compliance or security requirements**, as the resources are isolated from other tenants’ workloads, ensuring a more controlled environment.
   
3. **Control Over Hardware**:
   - Sole-tenant nodes give you more **control over the hardware** on which your applications run, allowing you to specify machine types and other hardware resources.

4. **Better Performance**:
   - Since the hardware is not shared, there are no noisy neighbors or resource contention, leading to **more consistent performance** for your VMs.

5. **Flexible Instance Configuration**:
   - You can customize the configuration of your VM instances, such as the number of CPUs, amount of memory, and other machine properties based on the workload requirements.

## Use Cases for Sole-Tenant Nodes:

1. **High-Security Workloads**:
   - For workloads that need physical isolation (e.g., compliance with regulations like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR).

2. **Legacy Applications**:
   - If you're running legacy applications that are not designed to work in multi-tenant environments or need to be isolated for performance reasons.

3. **Licensing**:
   - Some software licenses require that the VM be isolated on dedicated physical machines to ensure that licensing terms are adhered to (e.g., Oracle or other vendor-specific licensing).

4. **Predictable Performance**:
   - When performance predictability is a high priority, as shared resources on standard nodes can cause fluctuations due to contention.

## How Sole-Tenant Nodes Work:

1. **Node Placement**:
   - When you create a VM on a sole-tenant node, you have to specify the **node affinity** or the specific **sole-tenant node** to place the instance. This node will then be dedicated to your use.

2. **VM Scheduling**:
   - Google Cloud does not automatically place a VM on a sole-tenant node unless you specify it. If no sole-tenant node exists that meets the requirements, the VM cannot be scheduled until resources become available.

3. **Resource Isolation**:
   - All resources on the node are isolated, including CPUs, memory, and storage, ensuring that your workloads are physically separated from other customers’ workloads.

## Creating a Sole-Tenant Node:

1. **Create a Node Template**:
   - You need to create a node template that specifies the hardware configuration for the sole-tenant nodes. This template can define machine type, the number of CPUs, and other relevant configuration parameters.

2. **Create the Sole-Tenant Node**:
   - After creating the node template, you can create a sole-tenant node using the template.
   
3. **Create a VM on a Sole-Tenant Node**:
   - When launching a VM, you can specify the node affinity to ensure that the VM is placed on the dedicated node.

## Benefits of Sole-Tenant Nodes:
```
Physical Isolation: VMs run on dedicated hardware, which helps meet compliance and security requirements.
Performance Consistency: No resource contention with other tenants, ensuring better performance.
Customization: Ability to specify the exact hardware configuration and resources for VMs.
Compliance: Useful for workloads that need to meet strict regulatory and compliance standards.

```
## Considerations:

```
Cost: Sole-tenant nodes typically incur higher costs than shared nodes due to dedicated resources.
Resource Availability: If there’s no available sole-tenant node in the selected zone, you may face limitations in scheduling VMs.
Management: You need to manage the placement of VMs on sole-tenant nodes manually.
```

# Committed Use Discounts (CUD) in GCP
